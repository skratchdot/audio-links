    "description": "Tone.js is a very well thought out wrapper library for the Web Audio API. It’s targeted at two groups of users - those who want to build musical applications, and those familiar with traditional graph-based environments such as Pure Data or Max/MSP. For the former, Tone.js offers a robust, powerful sequencer library and some built in synthesisers with sensible presets. For the latter, it offers a comprehensive set of building blocks for performing signal processing tasks. Using the native nodes provided by the Web Audio API, the author, Yotam Mann, has created wrappers that allow standard arithmetic operations (addition, modulo, multiplication), logic operations and signal routing. All of this has been achieved without relying on ScriptProcesserNodes so they can take advantage of the low-latency native audio generation. Tone.js looks like a very useful library at an ideal level of abstraction for any Web Audio project.",

The tests for the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs are still at a very early stage though, and could really use your help. Writing tests, or porting them from the Webkit, Blink or Gecko code bases, is a great way to improve support for the APIs, and will make it easier for other vendors to add support. I wrote a blog post to show you how to get involved.",

If you’ve built an instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when the user switches browser focus to another tab. It’s event-based too, so it’s easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.",

    "description": "In this blog post, Matthew Rahtz shows how to synthesise string sounds using the Web Audio API. He starts with a simple introduction into the physics of how guitars, for example, make sound using a series of interactive visualisations. He then gets into the Karplus-Strong algorithm itself, which is capable of generating an amazing variety of sounds from a simple set of principles. A great article.",

    "description": "Soundslice is an interactive sheet music and guitar tabulator viewer that uses Canvas and Web Audio together to help musicians learn songs and share their transcriptions and compositions. As the music plays the sheet music highlights the current note in real time. If a particular passage is proving tricky to master, the tempo can be reduced. Synthesised sounds can replace real sounds, making it pleasant to listen to even at low tempos. The polish and ease of use is really impressive, and it’s great to see Web Audio technology being used in a commercial product. I’m hoping to interview Adrian at Soundslice for a future issue of this newsletter to get an insight into the technical implementation - so watch this space.",

It’s very slickly implemented with a number of bundled examples, with the developers requesting donations to help them build more. The code is closed source, but I assume, like CoffeeCollider featured in the last issue, that the generated samples are buffered into a scriptProcessorNode for playback. The Web Audio API provides many native nodes which are more efficient and achieve lower latency, and it would be interesting to see in the future if some of these live coding environments decide to take advantage of them.",

The resulting graphs show the frequency content of each individual chirp as a spectogram (a representation of the frequency content of sound), but arranged over time to give an indication of the rhythm of the whole bird song. The script processor and analyser nodes provided by the Web Audio API are used for the analysis, and canvas and SVG are used together for the visualisation.",

It’s fantastic news for Web Audio, as having another implementation has really helped to drive the standard forwards. I’m really pleased for the Mozilla team, it’s a great milestone. As well as the announcement, the team also released a great demo and blog post showcasing some of the 3D sound capabilities of the API. If you’re at all interested in Web Audio, go and grab a copy of FF25, try some of your favourite demos and give some feedback.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies. But listening to white noise for long periods is fatiguing. This application generates a natural sound of rain falling.

It’s very slickly implemented with a number of bundled examples, with the developers requesting donations to help them build more. The code is closed source, but I assume, like CoffeeCollider featured in the last issue, that the generated samples are buffered into a scriptProcessorNode for playback. The Web Audio API provides many native nodes which are more efficient and achieve lower latency, and it would be interesting to see in the future if some of these live coding environments decide to take advantage of them.",

If you’ve built an instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when the user switches browser focus to another tab. It’s event-based too, so it’s easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies.

You advance through the song, and its visuals, by scrolling through the page. This action changes the tempo and transitions chords algorithmically. Web Audio hackers might like the GUI mode where the various parameters that control the piece can be tweaked.",

I like how the synth comes with a selection of great-sounding presets, and changing any of the parameters allows you to save the changes as your own custom patch.",

For the latter, it offers a comprehensive set of building blocks for performing signal processing tasks. Using the native nodes provided by the Web Audio API, the author, Yotam Mann, has created wrappers that allow standard arithmetic operations (addition, modulo, multiplication), logic operations and signal routing.

    "description": "Tone.js is a very well thought out wrapper library for the Web Audio API. It’s targeted at two groups of users - those who want to build musical applications, and those familiar with traditional graph-based environments such as Pure Data or Max/MSP. For the former, Tone.js offers a robust, powerful sequencer library and some built in synthesisers with sensible presets. For the latter, it offers a comprehensive set of building blocks for performing signal processing tasks. Using the native nodes provided by the Web Audio API, the author, Yotam Mann, has created wrappers that allow standard arithmetic operations (addition, modulo, multiplication), logic operations and signal routing. All of this has been achieved without relying on ScriptProcesserNodes so they can take advantage of the low-latency native audio generation. Tone.js looks like a very useful library at an ideal level of abstraction for any Web Audio project.",

The resulting graphs show the frequency content of each individual chirp as a spectogram (a representation of the frequency content of sound), but arranged over time to give an indication of the rhythm of the whole bird song. The script processor and analyser nodes provided by the Web Audio API are used for the analysis, and canvas and SVG are used together for the visualisation.",

It’s very slickly implemented with a number of bundled examples, with the developers requesting donations to help them build more. The code is closed source, but I assume, like CoffeeCollider featured in the last issue, that the generated samples are buffered into a scriptProcessorNode for playback. The Web Audio API provides many native nodes which are more efficient and achieve lower latency, and it would be interesting to see in the future if some of these live coding environments decide to take advantage of them.",

As the music plays the sheet music highlights the current note in real time. If a particular passage is proving tricky to master, the tempo can be reduced. Synthesised sounds can replace real sounds, making it pleasant to listen to even at low tempos. The polish and ease of use is really impressive, and it’s great to see Web Audio technology being used in a commercial product. I’m hoping to interview Adrian at Soundslice for a future issue of this newsletter to get an insight into the technical implementation - so watch this space.",

Although these changes have been agreed, it will take a while for them to specified and a little longer still before they start to appear in browsers, but they should make many more things possible when they arrive.",

What I love about this post is how Paul details the various approaches he took to achieving a reliable tuning algorithm as well as how he went the extra mile to make it work offline (using Service Workers) and as a “home screen” app (using manifests). I spoke to Web Audio spec co-editor Chris Wilson today and he said he’s now deleted all his other guitar tuning apps in favour of this one - high praise indeed!",

As the music plays the sheet music highlights the current note in real time. If a particular passage is proving tricky to master, the tempo can be reduced. Synthesised sounds can replace real sounds, making it pleasant to listen to even at low tempos. The polish and ease of use is really impressive, and it’s great to see Web Audio technology being used in a commercial product. I’m hoping to interview Adrian at Soundslice for a future issue of this newsletter to get an insight into the technical implementation - so watch this space.",

Although these changes have been agreed, it will take a while for them to specified and a little longer still before they start to appear in browsers, but they should make many more things possible when they arrive.",

As well as the announcement, the team also released a great demo and blog post showcasing some of the 3D sound capabilities of the API.

Chen is a Creative Director at Google Creative Lab and has produced some other amazing audio-visual projects, including the 2011 Les Paul Google Doodle.",

As the music plays the sheet music highlights the current note in real time. If a particular passage is proving tricky to master, the tempo can be reduced. Synthesised sounds can replace real sounds, making it pleasant to listen to even at low tempos. The polish and ease of use is really impressive, and it’s great to see Web Audio technology being used in a commercial product. I’m hoping to interview Adrian at Soundslice for a future issue of this newsletter to get an insight into the technical implementation - so watch this space.",

When complete you can remix the song by completing the puzzles in different ways. It’s an interesting concept and quite hard to explain, but a lot of fun to play. The author Yotam Mann has also written a post about the technology behind the game, which is also well worth a read.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies. But listening to white noise for long periods is fatiguing. This application generates a natural sound of rain falling. To avoid becoming repetitive the app uses the Web Audio API to seamlessly blend different sounds together to create a different backdrop every day.",

As the music plays the sheet music highlights the current note in real time. If a particular passage is proving tricky to master, the tempo can be reduced. Synthesised sounds can replace real sounds, making it pleasant to listen to even at low tempos. The polish and ease of use is really impressive, and it’s great to see Web Audio technology being used in a commercial product. I’m hoping to interview Adrian at Soundslice for a future issue of this newsletter to get an insight into the technical implementation - so watch this space.",

The tutorial uses Adam’s Dilla library which takes its inspiration from the classic Akai MPC60 sequencer by allowing you to schedule beats in 96th beat increments. I love the simple notation language for scheduling the beats and the way Adam uses it to create the groove.",

Writing tests, or porting them from the Webkit, Blink or Gecko code bases, is a great way to improve support for the APIs, and will make it easier for other vendors to add support. I wrote a blog post to show you how to get involved.",

    "description": "Cristiano Belloni announced the alpha release of his Web Audio DAW (digital audio workstation) this week. It’s already a very impressive tool, with the ability to combine a number of custom effects and instruments together using a graph-like interface, share and save your creations, and create new plugins using the javascript console and a custom set of libraries. MIDI support and the ability to connect a microphone are there too. I think this is going to be really powerful if people start developing plugins for it, but for now Cristiano will no doubt appreciate everyone having a play and sending feedback.",

There’s not a lot of documentation for the Web MIDI API out there yet, mainly due to its limited support in existing browsers (only Chrome has support at the moment). But tutorials such as this should let developers build some compelling demos of the potentials of the API.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies. But listening to white noise for long periods is fatiguing. This application generates a natural sound of rain falling. To avoid becoming repetitive the app uses the Web Audio API to seamlessly blend different sounds together to create a different backdrop every day.",

If you’ve built an instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when the user switches browser focus to another tab. It’s event-based too, so it’s easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.",

I like how the synth comes with a selection of great-sounding presets, and changing any of the parameters allows you to save the changes as your own custom patch.",

Although these changes have been agreed, it will take a while for them to specified and a little longer still before they start to appear in browsers, but they should make many more things possible when they arrive.",

If you’ve built an instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when the user switches browser focus to another tab. It’s event-based too, so it’s easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.",

If you’ve built an instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when the user switches browser focus to another tab. It’s event-based too, so it’s easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.",

    "description": "Tone.js is a very well thought out wrapper library for the Web Audio API. It’s targeted at two groups of users - those who want to build musical applications, and those familiar with traditional graph-based environments such as Pure Data or Max/MSP. For the former, Tone.js offers a robust, powerful sequencer library and some built in synthesisers with sensible presets. For the latter, it offers a comprehensive set of building blocks for performing signal processing tasks. Using the native nodes provided by the Web Audio API, the author, Yotam Mann, has created wrappers that allow standard arithmetic operations (addition, modulo, multiplication), logic operations and signal routing. All of this has been achieved without relying on ScriptProcesserNodes so they can take advantage of the low-latency native audio generation. Tone.js looks like a very useful library at an ideal level of abstraction for any Web Audio project.",

Here the pianos are Web Audio-based, and the visualisation shows them drifting slowly in and out of sync. Chen is a Creative Director at Google Creative Lab and has produced some other amazing audio-visual projects, including the 2011 Les Paul Google Doodle.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies. But listening to white noise for long periods is fatiguing. This application generates a natural sound of rain falling. To avoid becoming repetitive the app uses the Web Audio API to seamlessly blend different sounds together to create a different backdrop every day.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies. But listening to white noise for long periods is fatiguing. This application generates a natural sound of rain falling. To avoid becoming repetitive the app uses the Web Audio API to seamlessly blend different sounds together to create a different backdrop every day.",

    "description": "AudioKeys, a library from Kyle Stetz, allows you to map the keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard to musical notes. If you’ve built an instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when the user switches browser focus to another tab. It’s event-based too, so it’s easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.",

    "description": "Tone.js is a very well thought out wrapper library for the Web Audio API. It’s targeted at two groups of users - those who want to build musical applications, and those familiar with traditional graph-based environments such as Pure Data or Max/MSP. For the former, Tone.js offers a robust, powerful sequencer library and some built in synthesisers with sensible presets. For the latter, it offers a comprehensive set of building blocks for performing signal processing tasks. Using the native nodes provided by the Web Audio API, the author, Yotam Mann, has created wrappers that allow standard arithmetic operations (addition, modulo, multiplication), logic operations and signal routing. All of this has been achieved without relying on ScriptProcesserNodes so they can take advantage of the low-latency native audio generation. Tone.js looks like a very useful library at an ideal level of abstraction for any Web Audio project.",

While music works well to mask background sounds, it can be distracting. Some people advocate listening to white noise due to its broad range of frequencies. But listening to white noise for long periods is fatiguing. This application generates a natural sound of rain falling. To avoid becoming repetitive the app uses the Web Audio API to seamlessly blend different sounds together to create a different backdrop every day.",

It’s very slickly implemented with a number of bundled examples, with the developers requesting donations to help them build more. The code is closed source, but I assume, like CoffeeCollider featured in the last issue, that the generated samples are buffered into a scriptProcessorNode for playback. The Web Audio API provides many native nodes which are more efficient and achieve lower latency, and it would be interesting to see in the future if some of these live coding environments decide to take advantage of them.",
